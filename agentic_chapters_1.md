Looking at your template, let me apply it to the first 3 chapters of our "Agentic Development" book:

---

# CHAPTER 1: The Art of Constraint

## CHAPTER SPECIFICATIONS
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter 1: The Art of Constraint
- **Part**: Part I: Fundamentals of Human-AI Programming
- **Target Word Count**: 3,000-3,500 words
- **Chapter Position**: 1 of 12 - foundational opening chapter

## CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
**Primary Goal**: Establish that successful AI collaboration comes from setting the right boundaries, not giving more instructions

**Key Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand why unbounded problems lead AI agents "off the rails"
- Distinguish between helpful constraints vs restrictive micromanagement
- Recognize the counterintuitive nature of "less instruction, better results"
- Build intuition for problem decomposition

**Critical Concepts to Cover**:
- The paradox of creative constraints
- Cognitive load theory applied to AI interactions
- Problem scope as the primary success factor
- The "shopping list vs recipe" distinction

## NARRATIVE BRIDGES
**Connection from Previous Chapter**: N/A - Opening chapter

**Setup for Next Chapter**: "Understanding constraints is just the first step. Chapter 2 explores how human and AI cognition differ, and why these differences make constraint-based collaboration so powerful."

## CHAPTER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
**Opening Scenario**: Developer asks AI to "improve the filtering system" and gets a complete rewrite that breaks everything vs asking to "add a single dropdown filter for status field"

**Key Examples to Include**:
- Side-by-side comparison of bounded vs unbounded requests
- Real refactoring disaster from our earlier conversation
- Creative constraint examples from other fields (haikus, architecture)

**Code/Tool Examples**: 
- Simple React component modifications (good vs bad prompts)
- File structure constraints for large codebases

**Common Pitfalls to Address**: 
- Assuming more detail always helps
- Fear of being "too restrictive" with AI
- Confusing constraints with micromanagement

**Actionable Takeaways**: 
- "Constraint checklist" before making any AI request
- Template for breaking down large problems
- Red flags that indicate a problem is too broad

# CHAPTER 2: Cognitive Partnerships

## CHAPTER SPECIFICATIONS
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter 2: Cognitive Partnerships
- **Part**: Part I: Fundamentals of Human-AI Programming
- **Target Word Count**: 3,500-4,000 words
- **Chapter Position**: 2 of 12 - building psychological foundation

## CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
**Primary Goal**: Help readers understand how human and AI thinking patterns complement each other when properly aligned

**Key Learning Outcomes**:
- Recognize AI's pattern matching strengths vs human's contextual judgment
- Understand the "yes-person" problem and how to counteract it
- Learn when to lead vs when to follow AI suggestions
- Develop realistic expectations for AI capabilities

**Critical Concepts to Cover**:
- AI attention patterns and context degradation
- Human bias toward agreement vs critical analysis
- Complementary cognitive strengths
- The illusion of AI "understanding"
- Trust calibration strategies

## NARRATIVE BRIDGES
**Connection from Previous Chapter**: "Chapter 1 showed why constraints matter. But to set the right constraints, you need to understand how your AI partner actually 'thinks' - and how that differs from human cognition."

**Setup for Next Chapter**: "Now that we understand the cognitive dynamics, Chapter 3 tackles the biggest practical challenge: managing complexity when projects grow beyond what either human or AI can hold in their head."

## CHAPTER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
**Opening Scenario**: Developer asks "Should I refactor this large file?" and gets enthusiastic agreement, then realizes AI doesn't actually know the codebase well enough to make that judgment

**Key Examples to Include**:
- The "agreeable AI" problem from our conversation
- Context window demonstrations with actual token counts
- Decision-making scenarios where human judgment is critical

**Code/Tool Examples**: 
- Prompts designed to elicit critical analysis instead of agreement
- Context management strategies for large codebases

**Common Pitfalls to Address**: 
- Treating AI like a junior developer who knows your codebase
- Over-relying on AI for strategic decisions
- Assuming AI disagreement means you're wrong

**Actionable Takeaways**: 
- Question templates that force critical analysis
- Guidelines for when to trust AI vs human judgment
- Red flags that indicate AI is agreeing without understanding

# CHAPTER 3: The Complexity Problem

## CHAPTER SPECIFICATIONS
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter 3: The Complexity Problem
- **Part**: Part I: Fundamentals of Human-AI Programming
- **Target Word Count**: 4,000-4,500 words
- **Chapter Position**: 3 of 12 - concluding foundational concepts

## CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
**Primary Goal**: Provide concrete strategies for managing complexity that exceeds both human and AI cognitive limits

**Key Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand context window limitations in practical terms
- Master session design and context management
- Learn hierarchical decomposition strategies
- Recognize when complexity requires architectural changes

**Critical Concepts to Cover**:
- Context window mathematics and attention degradation
- Session boundary design
- Information architecture for AI collaboration
- The "documentation as interface" pattern
- Complexity vs complication distinction

## NARRATIVE BRIDGES
**Connection from Previous Chapter**: "Chapter 2 explored how humans and AI think differently. But what happens when the problem is too complex for either to fully grasp? This is where most agentic development projects fail."

**Setup for Next Chapter**: "Understanding complexity management sets the foundation for Part II, where we'll translate these principles into specific development practices, starting with decomposition strategies."

## CHAPTER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
**Opening Scenario**: Developer tries to get AI help with a 20-file React application and watches the suggestions get progressively more confused and contradictory

**Key Examples to Include**:
- Context window demonstration with real codebase
- Session design patterns for large projects
- Before/after examples of complexity management

**Code/Tool Examples**: 
- Documentation templates that AI can effectively use
- Project structure patterns that work well with context limits
- Tools like Cline and their context management strategies

**Common Pitfalls to Address**: 
- Trying to explain entire codebase in one session
- Ignoring context degradation signs
- Ad-hoc complexity management instead of systematic approach

**Actionable Takeaways**: 
- Session planning template for complex projects
- Context management checklist
- Signs that indicate you need to restructure your approach
- Documentation patterns that preserve context across sessions

Does this capture the right level of detail and progression you're looking for?
