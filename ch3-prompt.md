- Information architecture patterns for AI collaboration
- The "documentation as interface" approach
- Complexity vs complication distinction in software projects
- Hierarchical decomposition strategies

**Chapter Success Criteria:**
- Reader can estimate context window usage for their projects
- Reader has systematic session planning templates
- Reader can identify when a project requires architectural changes for AI collaboration
- Reader understands how to structure information for AI consumption
- Reader can design documentation that preserves context across sessions

## Narrative Flow

**Connection from Previous Chapter:** "Chapter 2 explored how humans and AI think differently and how to leverage those differences. But what happens when the problem becomes too complex for either human or AI to fully grasp? This is where most agentic development projects fail - not from bad collaboration, but from poor complexity management."

**Setup for Next Chapter:** "Understanding complexity management principles sets the foundation for Part II, where we'll translate these insights into specific development practices. Chapter 4 will start with decomposition strategies - the systematic approach to breaking down complex problems into manageable AI-friendly tasks."

## Content Requirements

**Opening Scenario:** Developer tries to get AI help with a mature React application (20+ components, multiple contexts, complex state management). Shows the progression: first session works well, second session gets confused about earlier decisions, third session suggests changes that conflict with existing architecture. By session four, the AI is essentially working blind, making suggestions that break fundamental assumptions. Contrast with developer who structures the same project with clear session boundaries and documentation interfaces.

**Key Examples to Include:**

**Context Window Demonstration:**
- Real codebase analysis showing token counts
- Before/after examples of context window filling
- Practical measurements: "A typical React component file uses X tokens"
- Visual representation of attention degradation over conversation length

**Session Design Patterns:**
- **Single-Feature Sessions:** Complete a specific feature from start to finish
- **Architecture Review Sessions:** Focus only on high-level design decisions
- **Debugging Sessions:** Systematic problem isolation and resolution
- **Refactoring Sessions:** Bounded improvements with clear scope

**Information Architecture Examples:**
- **Project README as AI Interface:** Structure that AI can effectively parse
- **Component Documentation Standards:** What information AI needs to understand your code
- **Decision Logs:** How to preserve architectural context across sessions
- **Dependency Maps:** Visual and textual representations AI can use

**Hierarchical Decomposition Case Study:**
- Large feature broken down into AI-manageable chunks
- Show the decision tree: what gets tackled first, what depends on what
- Real examples of task boundaries that work vs boundaries that fail

**Code/Tool Examples:**
```javascript
// Example: Documentation structure that AI can effectively use
// vs documentation that looks good to humans but confuses AI

// Project structure patterns that support AI collaboration
// vs traditional structures that create context problems

// Session state management: how to hand off context between sessions
```

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Context Management Tools:** Overview of Cline, Claude Code, and similar tools
- **Documentation Generation:** Automated ways to create AI-friendly project summaries
- **Session Planning Templates:** Structured approaches to complex project work

**Common Pitfalls to Address:**
- **Trying to explain entire codebase in one session** - leads to context overload
- **Ignoring context degradation signs** - continuing conversations past useful limits
- **Ad-hoc complexity management** - handling complexity reactively instead of systematically
- **Over-relying on AI memory** - assuming AI remembers earlier architectural decisions
- **Mixing abstraction levels** - jumping between high-level architecture and implementation details in same session

**Actionable Takeaways:**
- **Session Planning Template:** Step-by-step process for approaching complex projects
- **Context Management Checklist:** How to recognize and handle context limits
- **Information Architecture Guidelines:** Standards for structuring AI-friendly documentation
- **Complexity Assessment Framework:** How to determine if a project needs architectural changes for AI collaboration
